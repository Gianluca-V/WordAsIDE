# WordAsIDE
This program is designed to convert text written in Microsoft Word to .exe with c++ code. The program currently requires MinGW to be installed on your computer in order to work. Please ensure that you have this installed before using the program.

# Usage
The program will open a control panel and a Microsoft Word file where you can write your c++ code, after writing the code you can click on the "Compile" button and it will create a .exe (and a .cpp) file, then you can click on "execute" and run the program. You can also click "Compile and execute" in order to do both at the same time.

You can also open already existing files and save your current one. The .cpp and .exe will be created in the same folder as your word file.

You can select your MinGW\bin path if you do not have it on the default one (C:\MinGW\bin).

With the language button you can alternate between Spanish and English language.

# Future Improvements
In the future, this program will be updated to remove the requirement for MinGW to be installed on your computer previously. Additionally, there may be additional features added to the program to make it more versatile and user-friendly (will my future self be able to implement intellisense?).
